SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS); as of the 2016 edition, is now worth your attention. Mobile-friendly, HTML 5, LESS CSS, Windows Authentication, paginated reports, KPIs, email subscriptions, and more.

If youâ€™re running anything older than SQL Server 2016, you may want to consider an upgrade. 
One option is SQL Server Express 2016; although, subscriptions, KPIs, and a few other features are not available in this free edition.

SSRS 2016:

To install SSRS, you&#39;ll need to install it as a feature within SQL Server setup:

![Install SSRS Feature](../images/stop_building_reporting_apps/install_ssrs_feature.png){:class="img-border"}

Once installed, look for &quot;Reporting Services Configuration Manager&quot;:

![SSRS Icon](../images/stop_building_reporting_apps/SSRS_config_icon.png){:class="img-border"}

Connect to the Report Server Instance. This is the same instance you just installed SSRS as a feature:

![Connect SSRS](../images/stop_building_reporting_apps/connect_ssrs_sql_instance.png){:class="img-border"}

You&#39;ll want to step through every menu item on the left side. Some options may be configured correctly by default, but will not go into effect until you click &quot;Apply&quot;.

## Report Services Configuration Manager menu:

- **&lt;Instance Name&gt;:** Ensure Report Service Status = &quot;Started&quot;.
- **Service Account:** Specify the  account to run the report server service.
- **Web Service URL:** Set the report server name and port. Click &quot;Apply&quot;.
  - This is the address you will connect to for publishing reports.
- **Database:** Click &quot;Change Database&quot; and select &quot;Create a new report server database&quot;.
  - The database server fields auto-populate, but the &quot;Server Name&quot; may be incorrect.
- **Web Portal URL:** Set the web portal URL. Click &quot;Apply&quot;.
  - This is the address users will need to view the web portal.

The rest of the menu items are optional, including &quot;E-mail Settings&quot; to enable email subscriptions and &quot;Subscription Settings&quot; to configure a file share account.

Now that your report server is ready (you can successfully navigate to the Web Portal URL), you&#39;ll want to download and install the SQL Server 2016 Report Builder.

If you don&#39;t specify the report server during the Report Builder install, you can still manually specify which report server to connect to on the bottom toolbar.

## Report Builder quick start:

- Click &quot;Blank Report&quot;.
- On the top of the report, add a title.
- Right-click &quot;Data Sources&quot; on the left "Report Data" toolbar and select &quot;Add Data Source&quot;.
- Choose &quot;Use a connection embedded in my report&quot;.
- Click &quot;Build&quot; just to the right of the connection string textarea.
  - For &quot;Server name&quot;, enter your SQL instance that contains data you want to report on.
  - Pick a database and click OK.
- Click OK to create your new data source.
- Right-click &quot;Datasets&quot; on the left toolbar and select &quot;Add Dataset&quot;.
- Choose &quot;Use a dataset embedded in my report&quot;.
- Under the &quot;Data Source&quot; dropdown, select the one you previously created.
- Choose the &quot;Text&quot; query type and add any functional query.
  - `SELECT GETDATE() AS [DATE]` will work if you don&#39;t have one ready.
- Click OK to create your new dataset.
- In the top menu, select &quot;Insert&quot;, then &quot;Table&gt;Table Wizard&quot;.
  - Select your new dataset. Click next.
  - Drag your fields from &quot;Available fields&quot; to &quot;Values&quot;. Click next.
  - For &quot;Choose the layout&quot;, click next, and then Finish.
- If you want to adjust the size of any columns, select the table and drag the grey boxes that appear.
- In the top menu, select &quot;Home&quot;, then &quot;Run&quot;.
- If you aren&#39;t currently connected to your report server, you&#39;ll want to do that first by selecting &quot;Connect&quot; on the bottom toolbar.
- Once your report is complete, in the top menu, select &quot;File&gt;Save As&quot;.
  - Name your report (the user will see this name). Click save.
- Navigate to your Web Portal URL and refresh the page to see your report.
- You can also create folders and specify permissions to collections of reports that reside within.

SSRS has come along way.
This is the first time that I feel it can be used as a suitable replacement for custom SQL Server reporting applications; which have a tendancy of consuming many development hours maintaining.
